=head1 NAME

Data::TreeValidator::Branch - A branch of tree validation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents a branch in the tree, ie something that has child nodes. Almost all
your validation specifications will have at least one tree (unless it really
only takes a single piece of input).

=head1 METHODS

=head2 children

Returns a list of all child nodes of this branch

=head2 child_names

Returns the names of all child nodes for this branch

=head2 add_child($name => $value)

Adds a child to the branch, with the name C<$name> and value C<$value>

=head2 child($name)

Returns the child with name C<$name>, or C<undef>

=head2 process($input)

Takes the input in C<$input> and validates it against this branch. The general
process here is to enumerate over each child of this branch, and fetch the
corresponding data from C<$input> and process that.

Returns a L<Data::TreeValidator:::Result::Branch>, which can be inspected to
determine if the branch validated, and for clean data.
